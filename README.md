# Slim Element

A tiny base class for building web components.

It enables some super light abstractions over vanilla web component authoring catered to my personal preferences.

## Usage

```bash
npm install slim-element
```

```js
import { SlimElement } from 'slim-element';

class WebComponent extends SlimElement {
  // ... implementation details ...
}
```
